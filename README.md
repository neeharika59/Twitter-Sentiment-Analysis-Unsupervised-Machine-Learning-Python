This project explores sentiment analysis on 1.6 million tweets from the Stanford CS Datasets (Aprilâ€“June 2009) using unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. We employed word2vec and pretrained models to capture contextual word associations, achieving F1 scores of 0.529 and 0.508, respectively. Our analysis revealed that Random Forest with N-grams performed best, reaching an F1 score of 0.73.

Key findings indicate that adjusted preprocessing, refined lexicon-based approaches, and eliminating borderline cases significantly improve sentiment classification. While existing models showed moderate performance, refining methodologies and adapting to evolving social media language remains essential for better sentiment analysis accuracy.
